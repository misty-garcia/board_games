Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills.

She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.&#10;    Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.&#10;    Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is no &quot;Alien player&quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.&#10;    Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.&#10;&#10;&#10;The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &quot;recalibrates&quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.&#10;&#10;The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.&#10;    The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.&#10;&#10;&#10;With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &quot;alien signals&quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Warrior Knights", "rank": "1023", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.465\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.86\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3730\t\t", "name": "Warrior Knights", "year": "2006", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "120", "max_time": "240", "designer": "Derek Carver", "category": ["Medieval", "Negotiation", "Political", "Wargame"], "mechanic": ["Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hexagon Grid", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Turn Order: Random", "Voting"], "publisher": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Devir", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Nexus Editrice", "Ubik"], "description": "The Kingdom is in chaos. The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?&#10;&#10;In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.&#10;&#10;Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.&#10;&#10;In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.&#10;&#10;The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Valley of the Kings: Afterlife", "rank": "1024", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.465\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.32\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1539\t\t", "name": "Valley of the Kings: Afterlife", "year": "2015", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Tom Cleaver", "category": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Mythology", "Religious"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "publisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group", "Devir"], "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Take on the role of Egyptian nobles at the time of the pharaohs, preparing for their death and burial in the valley of the kings.

Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.&#10;&#10;In Capital, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.&#10;     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.&#10;&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.&#10;&#10;During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Factory Fun", "rank": "1040", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.454\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.82\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3364\t\t", "name": "Factory Fun", "year": "2006", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel", "category": ["Industry / Manufacturing", "Puzzle", "Real-time"], "mechanic": ["Modular Board", "Tile Placement"], "publisher": ["Cwali", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Players attempt to build the most successful factory to produce the best products by connecting input and output reservoirs smartly to your machines to build the most profitable factory!&#10;&#10;Players each start with a unique empty factory floor with a support pillar in the middle.

The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.&#10;&#10;While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design.

It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.&#10;&#10;VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.&#10;&#10;Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor!

Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Doomtown: Reloaded", "rank": "1055", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.447\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.20\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2036\t\t", "name": "Doomtown: Reloaded", "year": "2014", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Dave Williams (II)", "category": ["American West", "Card Game", "City Building", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Betting and Bluffing", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group"], "description": "The classic collectible card game Deadlands: Doomtown returns as an Expandable Card Game in Doomtown: Reloaded.

Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.&#10;&#10;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.&#10;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.&#10;&#10;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules overview from the official rules:&#10;&#10;The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos.

Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.&#10;&#10;The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn.

(Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)&#10;&#10;The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game is a set collection game at its core. Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.&#10;&#10;Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.&#10;&#10;Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.&#10;&#10;Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.&#10;&#10;After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.&#10;&#10;If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).&#10;&#10;When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.&#10;&#10;After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.&#10;&#10;The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Omen: A Reign of War", "rank": "1065", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.441\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.41\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1327\t\t", "name": "Omen: A Reign of War", "year": "2011", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "John Clowdus", "category": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Mythology"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Small Box Games", "Kolossal Games"], "description": "You are a child of Zeus poised to conquer all of Greece, but first you must prove your worth to the gods, as there is another who contests your claim.

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.&#10;&#10;Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way, some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn, the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.&#10;&#10;The country boards are also noteworthy, in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn, and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer, after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.&#10;&#10;A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.&#10;&#10;In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.&#10;&#10;A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with &quot;character&quot; keyples and keypers will also be released.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Undaunted: Normandy", "rank": "1078", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.437\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t8.04\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t857\t\t", "name": "Undaunted: Normandy", "year": "2019", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "60", "designer": "Trevor Benjamin", "category": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "mechanic": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building"], "publisher": ["Osprey Games", "Do it games", "Nuts!

You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.&#10;&#10;The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.&#10;&#10;After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.&#10;&#10;It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&#10;     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Keltis entry:&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&#10;     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&#10;     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&#10;     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&#10;     All this is added to the points scored during the game&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "The Reckoners", "rank": "1094", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.428\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.91\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t968\t\t", "name": "The Reckoners", "year": "2018", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "100", "designer": "Brett Sobol", "category": ["Dice", "Novel-based", "Science Fiction"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Push Your Luck", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Nauvoo Games"], "description": "The Reckoners, a game based on the young adult fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson, allows players to take on the roles of the novels' protagonists and work together to save the world.&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;10 years ago... A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called Epics. But, every Epic turned out to be evil. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named Steelheart reigns supreme!&#10;&#10;Nobody fights back... nobody but the Reckoners! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics. Your mission is simple, but not easy. Take down Steelheart and his Epics and save the city.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The Reckoners is a simultaneous, co-operative game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes. You win by defeating Steelheart. But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness. Throughout the game, you will work with your fellow Reckoners to research and attack Steelheart, but he is not alone. Numerous Epics are scattered throughout the city, and they will wreak havoc upon the population, if left unchecked. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then all Reckoners lose.&#10;&#10;The Reckoners determine which actions to take primarily through a simultaneous, dice rolling mechanism, where each player can keep and reroll results up to three times at their own pace. Equipment Cards and Plan Tokens will also allow you to gain extra actions or improve/manipulate the results of your dice. Actions are resolved simultaneously as well, so communication and collaborative planning are key to ensuring optimal outcomes.&#10;&#10;Your dice can be used to attack Epics, research Epics, contain Epics, attack Enforcement, earn money, acquire Plan Tokens, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. Researching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely. When all actions have been taken by The Reckoners, then it's the Epics turn.&#10;&#10;Each round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. Each Epic also has a unique set of actions it performs, so you're always facing multiple threats that function very differently. The crux of the game is deciding how to resolve these competing threats and prioritize your actions together to eliminate Epics and ultimately win the game. How, when, and where you act will determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;In short, The Reckoners plays like a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle. If you like co-operative games where you carefully manage resources, build powerful action combos, create tactical plans with your teammates, and work together to take down the bad guy while on the brink of defeat, then be sure to check out The Reckoners.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Middle-earth", "rank": "1095", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.428\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.26\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1760\t\t", "name": "Middle-earth", "year": "1995", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Coleman Charlton", "category": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Novel-based"], "mechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["999 Games", "ACE Pelit Oy", "Hexagonal", "Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE)", "Joc Internacional", "Queen Games"], "description": "ICE's now-out-of-print CCG (they lost their license to produce Middle-Earth products in 1999).

All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.&#10;&#10;In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Don't just make history-guide it!

You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card.

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.&#10;&#10;The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.&#10;&#10;So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.&#10;&#10;These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar.

It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Ys", "rank": "1124", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.408\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.90\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2454\t\t", "name": "Ys", "year": "2004", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Cyril Demaegd", "category": ["Bluffing", "Medieval"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation"], "publisher": ["Ystari Games", "HUCH!", "Quined White Goblin Games", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "In remote times, King Gradlon had the magnificent city of Ys erected for his daughter Dahut.

The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Hab & Gut", "rank": "1129", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.406\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.08\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1807\t\t", "name": "Hab & Gut", "year": "2008", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Carlo A.

The game is played using a &quot;roll and write&quot; mechanic, where one player rolls the dice, and from the results, each player individually picks one color die, representing a type of hex, and one number die, and uses their chosen combinations to fill in a hex on their individual player board.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one castle space already filled in; from there, a hex can only be filled on the board if it is adjacent to an already-filled hex. Each type of hex has its own rules for which numbers can be used to fill it. When completing a region of hexes, you score points and get a reward depending on the type of hex, which can be workers or monks that you can use to manipulate the dice, silver coins that you can spend to take extra actions or goods that you can later ship for even more points.

Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President.

Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "UBOOT: The Board Game", "rank": "1155", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.391\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.95\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1086\t\t", "name": "UBOOT: The Board Game", "year": "2019", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Bartosz Pluta", "category": ["Miniatures", "Nautical", "Real-time", "Wargame", "World War II"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Simulation", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Worker Placement"], "publisher": ["PHALANX", "ASYNCRON games", "Cranio Creations", "Crowd Games", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Pegasus Spiele"], "description": "U-BOOT: The Board Game is a fully cooperative, real-time tabletop game of WW2 submarine warfare, designed by Iron Wolf Studio. It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is driven by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.&#10;&#10;Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.&#10;&#10;The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.&#10;&#10;From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and different play styles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...&#10;&#10;The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest?

If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.&#10;&#10;At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests. Quest management becomes challenging for the player, however, because quests undertaken aren't completed immediately, but instead progress each turn and become more difficult. At specific time intervals, players will need to add more resources to their quests or face failure.&#10;&#10;Gameplay cycles through three different phases in each round. The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production.

Place six &quot;U-turn&quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &quot;moves&quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.&#10;&#10;If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!&#10;&#10;When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem. If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve. Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green, and 1 for yellow.

The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.&#10;&#10;Special Actions:&#10;Special actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.&#10;&#10;Rulebook and Playbook:&#10;The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples.

The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&#10;&#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&#10;&#10;Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&#10;&#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&#10;&#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame!

If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.

The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance. The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists &ndash; they become possessed by the lust for making this world better. They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their &ndash; great, according to them &ndash; ideas.&#10;&#10;Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth &mdash; or as a last resort make them vanish. Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?&#10;&#10;From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them.

When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.&#10;&#10;The game may end in one of the three ways:&#10;&#10;    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,&#10;    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,&#10;    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;INITIATIVE PHASE:&#10;During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.&#10;&#10;PLANNING PHASE:&#10;Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.&#10;&#10;ACTION PHASE:&#10;Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.&#10;&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.&#10;&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence&#10;&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)&#10;&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region&#10;&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.&#10;&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.&#10;&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.&#10;&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.&#10;&#10;DOMINATION PHASE:&#10;Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Calimala", "rank": "1188", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.378\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.21\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1417\t\t", "name": "Calimala", "year": "2017", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "75", "max_time": "75", "designer": "Fabio Lopiano", "category": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Medieval"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Modular Board", "Worker Placement"], "publisher": ["ADC Blackfire Entertainment GmbH", "Arrakis Games", "Rightgames RBG SIA", "Stronghold Games"], "description": "The &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; &mdash; the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in foreign cloth &mdash; was one of the greater guilds of Florence, who arrogated to themselves the civic power of the Republic of Florence during the Late Middle Ages.

(Each street connects two places where particular actions can be taken.) While taking these actions, players produce and deliver cloth and contribute to the construction and decoration of various buildings across the city. Employees stay on their assigned places for a while, carrying out their actions whenever the street is activated, and eventually are promoted into the city council, triggering a scoring phase.&#10;&#10;Depending on the number of players, each player has a number of action discs. In turn order, they can put one on a space between two actions, performing both actions and activating all other discs on the same space. When the fourth disc is placed on an action space, the lowest one is promoted to the city council, which triggers a scoring. After the last action disc is placed or the last scoring phase in the council is triggered, the game ends. The positions of the action spaces and sequence of scoring phases vary from game to game, making each game very different.

Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.

Each player has a set of 15 &quot;men&quot; that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard&gt; which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.&#10;&#10;It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&#10;&#10;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930's.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Shogi", "rank": "1217", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.359\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.33\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1384\t\t", "name": "Shogi", "year": "1587", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "60", "designer": "(Uncredited)", "category": ["Abstract Strategy"], "mechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Square Grid"], "publisher": ["(Public Domain)", "(Self-Published)", "(Unknown)", "Aztral Games", "The Elephant Chess Club", "F.X.

There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Mystery of the Abbey", "rank": "1218", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.358\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.55\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t7425\t\t", "name": "Mystery of the Abbey", "year": "1995", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Bruno Faidutti", "category": ["Deduction", "Medieval", "Murder/Mystery", "Religious"], "mechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Events", "Hand Management", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Set Collection"], "publisher": ["Days of Wonder", "Edge Entertainment", "Giochi Uniti", "KDS Distribuzione (Italy)", "MultiSim"], "description": "Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue.

Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.

If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: Discoveries can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;Integratable with:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Timeline: Diversity&#10;    Timeline: Events&#10;    Timeline: Inventions&#10;    Timeline: Music & Cinema&#10;    Timeline: American History&#10;    Timeline: Americana&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Beyond Balderdash", "rank": "1224", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.354\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.82\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2777\t\t", "name": "Beyond Balderdash", "year": "1993", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Laura Robinson", "category": ["Bluffing", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "mechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Voting"], "publisher": ["Canada Games", "Casper", "Drumond Park Ltd.", "Hasbro", "Parker Brothers", "Popular de Juguetes", "Tactic", "Ventura Games"], "description": "Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.  Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.  Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.&#10;&#10;The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a &quot;Date&quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.&#10;&#10;Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).

Players then take actions in turn order, moving samurai on the board as needed (paying $1 per space moved) in order to complete actions (to the forest for wood, the rice fields for rice, cities to build, and so on). Before a player can move samurai, however, he must use an action to place them on the game board; some actions allow free movement, and others allow a player to recruit additional samurai beyond the initial five.&#10;&#10;One other action allows you to recruit additional action cards from an array on the side of the game board, thereby giving you four (or more) cards from which to choose for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Building in cities costs resources and gives you points as well as money; as more players build in a city, the funds are split among all present, with those first in the city receiving a larger share. Players can also receive points or buy stone by dealing with a traveling merchant.&#10;&#10;Once at least one player has twelve points, the game finishes at the end of the round, with players scoring endgame bonuses for money in hand and other things.

The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.&#10;&#10;Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &quot;Chinese Chess&quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.&#10;&#10;The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.&#10;    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.&#10;    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.&#10;    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.&#10;    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.&#10;    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.&#10;    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pieces capture as they move and never jump.

At the heart of the game's conflicts are its disks, which represent heroes and units from across the Old World. During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps. When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be &quot;pinning&quot; the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another. By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Diskwars has been updated to its new setting within the Warhammer world and features flexible rules for hero-centric army-building. Additionally, whereas the original Diskwars was a collectible game, Warhammer: Diskwars has moved away from the blind buy model, and the Core Set includes everything you need to play the game: a host of terrain cards, objectives, command cards, and more than sixty disks for the game's four races.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Welcome Back to the Dungeon", "rank": "1228", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.353\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.82\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2627\t\t", "name": "Welcome Back to the Dungeon", "year": "2016", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Antoine Bauza", "category": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "mechanic": ["Memory", "Player Elimination", "Push Your Luck"], "publisher": ["Devir", "Gemblo, Inc.", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Mancalamaro", "PopcornEdu", "Portal Games", "Reflexshop", "REXhry", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "The sun is shining in the Abysmal Woods where you&rsquo;re strolling without a care in the world, your weapon at your belt, dreams of adventure in your head.

Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.&#10;&#10;Braking sections have a particular feature: here players and robots can try late braking, a dangerous maneuver that allows them to overtake multiple cars simultaneously. Other maneuvers or cards require a &quot;check&quot;, e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target.&#10;&#10;Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.&#10;&#10;Race! is a board game with no dice in which strategy and risk melt together to convey a truly intense and deep racing experience.

On each turn, players choose one of these actions :&#10;&#10;     Start a new building with his architect&#10;     Complete part of a building&#10;     Send a worker to a zone of influence&#10;     Take a leader card&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;By contributing to the numerous buildings, players acquire influence with the authorities of the time : religion, politics, commerce and culture. Players also help build the famous Citadelle.&#10;&#10;At the end of each century, there is a scoring round where players get victory points for the workers they managed to send in the 5 zones of influence. Qu&eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence. Players must not only fight to get majorities, they must also erect the most prestigious buildings.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fourth century. Players then receive points for the buildings they completed. The player with the most points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Qu&eacute;bec won the Plateau d'or 2007 and was shortlisted at the 2007 Boulogne-Billancourt International Designer Contest.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Exit: The Game \u2013 The Sunken Treasure", "rank": "1237", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.349\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.23\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1279\t\t", "name": "Exit: The Game \u2013 The Sunken Treasure", "year": "2017", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Inka Brand", "category": ["Deduction"], "mechanic": ["Cooperative Game"], "publisher": ["999 Games", "Devir", "Dino Toys s. r. o.", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "IELLO", "KOSMOS", "Venner\u00f8d Forlag AS", "Zvezda"], "description": "Exit: The Game &ndash; The Sunken Treasure is a puzzle game modeled after escape rooms.&#10;&#10;Starting with season 3, the Exit series is divided into difficulty levels. &quot;The Sunken Treasure&quot; is categorized at beginners level.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Legend of the Five Rings", "rank": "1238", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.349\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.15\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1582\t\t", "name": "Legend of the Five Rings", "year": "1995", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "8", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Jeff Alexander", "category": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Medieval"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection"], "publisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group", "Five Rings Publishing Group", "Wizards of the Coast"], "description": "A collectible card game, set in a fantasy empire called Rokugan, based loosely upon medieval Japan and Japanese Mythology.&#10;&#10;The factions available have changed over the editions, but generally include the 7 Great Clans: Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, and Unicorn. Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.&#10;&#10;The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.&#10;&#10;Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.&#10;&#10;L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.&#10;&#10;The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: &#10;&#10;     Clan War, a miniatures game.&#10;     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.&#10;     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.&#10;     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.&#10;&#10;In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.&#10;&#10;In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.&#10;&#10;Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.&#10;&#10;In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.&#10;&#10;2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.&#10;&#10;In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017.

Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Transatlantic", "rank": "1251", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.343\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.17\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1386\t\t", "name": "Transatlantic", "year": "2017", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Mac Gerdts", "category": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Nautical", "Transportation"], "mechanic": ["Action Retrieval", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Modular Board"], "publisher": ["PD-Verlag", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "From the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 to the beginning of WWI in 1914, there was an amazing development of bigger, faster, and more modern steamships.

They purchase new steamships from the market, each of them historical with their individual technical data (tons, knots etc.).

In order to let a shipping company flourish, purchasing the best steamships is not enough, if one fails to acquire enough coal bunkers and trade posts as well.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by cards; on each turn, play one card and execute the related action.

Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.&#10;&#10;The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.&#10;&#10;Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is &quot;active&quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.&#10;&#10;In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &quot;ritual sites&quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &quot;active landscapes&quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.&#10;&#10;Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.&#10;&#10;The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Deep Madness", "rank": "1254", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.339\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t8.10\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1136\t\t", "name": "Deep Madness", "year": "2018", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Chauncey", "category": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Diemension Games"], "description": "In a dark and claustrophobic deep sea mining site, the uncovering of a mysterious &ldquo;Sphere&rdquo; is dragging everyone nearby into the endless madness. The fears deep within one&rsquo;s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft&rsquo;s work and the Alien series. In the game, players assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.&#10;&#10;Deep Madness is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.&#10;&#10;In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.&#10;&#10;In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.&#10;&#10;Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.&#10;&#10;In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.&#10;&#10;In each investigator&rsquo;s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness. Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions. Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.&#10;&#10;Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.&#10;&#10;In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Eurorails", "rank": "1255", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.339\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.08\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1700\t\t", "name": "Eurorails", "year": "1990", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "180", "max_time": "240", "designer": "Darwin Bromley", "category": ["Economic", "Trains", "Transportation"], "mechanic": ["Crayon Rail System", "Network and Route Building", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "publisher": ["Mayfair Games"], "description": "Eurorails is another entry in the Mayfair Games crayon rail games, like Empire Builder and India Rails.

Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.&#10;    Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital.

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans &mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.&#10;&#10;In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.&#10;&#10;Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.&#10;&#10;After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.&#10;&#10;If you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Fireteam Zero", "rank": "1264", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.337\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.56\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1060\t\t", "name": "Fireteam Zero", "year": "2015", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Mike Langlois", "category": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Miniatures", "World War II"], "mechanic": ["Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Emergent Games (II)", "dV Giochi", "Edge Entertainment", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Meeple BR Jogos", "Play & Win", "Ulisses Spiele"], "description": "In 1942, four soldiers vanished from the training program of the newly formed First Ranger Battalion, their names stricken from the roster. Chosen for their unique skills, they would fight in secret against terrifying supernatural enemies and overwhelming odds. This is their story.&#10;&#10;Fireteam Zero is a cooperative game for up to four players who must cut a path through an endless swarm of deadly monsters in order to discover and defeat the ultimate evil behind them. Each player possesses a set of brutal combat skills that are represented by a deck of cards unique to that character. Play cards to devastate the creatures in your way, help your teammates survive the onslaught, or even reshape the tactical landscape with the proper application of explosive ordinance. The battle is fought across three maps of increasing difficulty, each one bringing more and tougher enemies than the last. Players must search for and complete mission objectives in order to progress and bring them one step closer to the final showdown.&#10;&#10;Aiding them are two NPC Specialists, one with an uncanny ability to sense the location and nature of the supernatural energy in the area and another with an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcane. Use the Specialists wisely or risk failure no matter how many monsters you defeat.&#10;&#10;Race against time as the creatures on the board become stronger and more cunning. The longer you take to complete your objectives, the more Monster Twist cards are revealed, each granting a new and terrible aspect to your enemy. In each set of missions you will face a different family of horrifying creatures, each with their own special abilities and twist cards.&#10;&#10;Players must not only fight for their lives, but at the same time they must make smart tactical choices with their teammates in order to make the best use of a limited resource, the cards in their hands. Each card not only represents an action that they can take, but also their health. Spending too many cards can leave you vulnerable, while spending too few can result in being overwhelmed. Clever players will rely on each other to succeed.&#10;&#10;Fireteam Zero is a story-rich board game of squad tactics and horror.

A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side. The supply system is card driven. The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Hit Z Road", "rank": "1270", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.332\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.79\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2752\t\t", "name": "Hit Z Road", "year": "2016", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "60", "designer": "Martin Wallace", "category": ["Fighting", "Zombies"], "mechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Push Your Luck"], "publisher": ["Asmodee", "Rebel", "Space Cowboys"], "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In the fast-paced and morbidly kitschy game Hit Z Road, you and your fellow players embark on a road trip going south from Chicago along America's famous Route 66 &mdash; now infested by zombies.

As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;&#10;A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple.

Its profits catapulted the British Empire to global dominance and shaped the fate of some of the world's great nations, but its ascent was anything but easy. The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.&#10;&#10;John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company's history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: Use the Company and the Company's trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end, you guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region's infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...&#10;&#10;As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It's even possible that the Company's trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late Company that can be played in about 90 minutes. The game also offers a full campaign game that will take players from 1720 to 1857 in an evening.&#10;&#10;Taking its inspiration from Phil Eklund's seminal Lords games, John Company offers Greed Incorporated by way of Republic of Rome &mdash; and with only sixty cards and multiple scenarios, John Company is one of the most accessible SMG offerings to date.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Odin's Ravens", "rank": "1281", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.329\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.66\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3545\t\t", "name": "Odin's Ravens", "year": "2002", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Thorsten Gimmler", "category": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Mythology", "Racing"], "mechanic": ["Hand Management"], "publisher": ["KOSMOS", "Rio Grande Games", "Tilsit"], "description": "Each morning, Odin sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to race over the world of Midgard and report back what they have seen.

Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.&#10;&#10;In the first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Odin's Ravens transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Odin deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire.

Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style board game of 60 to 120 minutes for 1 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Players are the heads of powerful guilds in the City. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the City in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.&#10;&#10;The Guilds exert their control in the city by sending agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of the City. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to the City's infrastructure.&#10;&#10;To win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the City such as defending it from external and internal threats.&#10;&#10;Here are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Card Crafting: Similar to the original card-crafting game, Mystic Vale, all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on one third (1/3) of the slip and are transparent on the other two thirds (2/3). During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). However, unlike Mystic Vale, the transparent cards are double-sided, and when you upgrade the &quot;good&quot; side of the cards (front), you also add strength to the &quot;bad&quot; side of the cards (back).&#10;     Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: Rather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different cards in that deck. Using other players' cards means you have to pay them. During the game you can claim allegiance of more cards in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal.&#10;     Card-driven worker placement: While your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. Advancements don't have a cost, instead they require the use of workers to a greater or lesser degree depending on the power of the card. e.g. many effects require placing or pulling workers from different city locations as dictated by the card effects. Since you have a limited number of workers to use, you will constantly be choosing to forgo one useful thing in order to do another.&#10;     Threat Tower:  There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and whom Threats will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Threat Board, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes of a given color accumulate on a card, it attacks the City. If the color matches one of the players, it attacks that player. If the color is black, it attacks all players!&#10;     Modular set up: Edge of Darkness will come with 12 Locations. Each game you use only 10 of these Locations, which can be specifically selected or chosen randomly, making for a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you will need to employ. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Crafting Slips. Location Boards may specify special rules for worker placement, or extend the basic rules with all new systems. For example, a combination of Location Boards can be used to assemble a party of heroes to take the fight to the Threat Tower and engage in a Monster Hunt!&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Serenissima (first edition)", "rank": "1330", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.307\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.87\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2189\t\t", "name": "Serenissima (first edition)", "year": "1996", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "120", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Dominique Ehrhard", "category": ["Economic", "Nautical", "Renaissance"], "mechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Trading"], "publisher": ["Descartes Editeur", "Eurogames", "999 Games"], "description": "The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Treasure Hunter", "rank": "1331", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.307\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.79\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2385\t\t", "name": "Treasure Hunter", "year": "2015", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "40", "max_time": "40", "designer": "Richard Garfield", "category": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Fantasy"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "publisher": ["Queen Games", "Arclight", "Piatnik", "Rebel"], "description": "Get as much valuable treasure and coins as you can as everything counts at the end of this five-round game!

For those who haven't played the classic fantasy adventure game Talisman, this means that on each turn, a player rolls a single six-sided die before moving his playing piece that number of spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise around the region (outer, middle, or inner) of the board it currently occupies. That player then draws a card or cards to see what he's encountered, pitting his heroic persona against foul enemies, dangerous locations, and fantastic strangers. And all the while, these intrepid heroes rise in power, as they work their way toward the ultimate goal at the center of the board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Bootleggers", "rank": "1353", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.300\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.68\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3094\t\t", "name": "Bootleggers", "year": "2004", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Don Beyer", "category": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Mafia", "Negotiation", "Transportation"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Card Drafting", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Trading"], "publisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Mayday Games"], "description": "It's January 1921.

Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.&#10;&#10;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.&#10;&#10;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.&#10;&#10;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.&#10;&#10;Revised using:&#10;&#10;    Talisman: Upgrade Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "GKR: Heavy Hitters", "rank": "1378", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.291\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.75\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t968\t\t", "name": "GKR: Heavy Hitters", "year": "2018", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Matt Hyra", "category": ["Miniatures", "Modern Warfare", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "mechanic": ["Action Queue", "Area Majority / Influence", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Take That"], "publisher": ["Cryptozoic Entertainment", "Weta Workshop"], "description": "Welcome to the biggest sport of the future &ndash; GIANT KILLER ROBOTS : HEAVY HITTERS!&#10;&#10;GKR: HEAVY HITTERS is an advertising-driven, televised combat sport where mega corporations fight for lucrative salvage rights and advertising dominance in Earth&rsquo;s abandoned cities.

Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).&#10;&#10;Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.&#10;&#10;The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.&#10;&#10;There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.

Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!&#10;&#10;Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader. While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor. Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.  Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace.&#10;&#10;Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.  Each round begins with the marketplace phase. Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.  Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.  Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.  Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.  An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.  After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income.  Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents.  The price for placing agents depends on the location.  Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.&#10;&#10;Each round concludes with selling phase.  Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village.  Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game.  Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house. Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in. Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round. End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Wasabi!", "rank": "1382", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.289\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.54\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t4651\t\t", "name": "Wasabi!", "year": "2008", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Josh Cappel", "category": ["Territory Building"], "mechanic": ["Hand Management", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "publisher": ["Pegasus Spiele", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Wasabi! is a light and fast game where you compete against other players to assemble your quota of unique sushi recipes in a rapidly dwindling space.

Sam is desperate and looks for answers everywhere he can, which leads to a weird meeting with Mark.&#10;&#10;Mark's son was once in a similar situation, and his father was able to help wake the boy up. He has given Sam a scary-looking book and said that inside this book he will find a ritual called &quot;The Awakening&quot;. But Mark warned Sam that he needs to prepare himself mentally since this ritual will transfer him into another dimension, where he should be able to find his daughter and understand what is the cause of this state. If Sam's lucky enough, then he will be able to wake her up as well. Sam has held onto the book for more than a week. Finally, he's ready to go into the basement and perform a ritual.

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Riff Raff", "rank": "1399", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.282\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.96\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1574\t\t", "name": "Riff Raff", "year": "2012", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Christoph Cantzler", "category": ["Action / Dexterity", "Party Game", "Pirates"], "mechanic": [], "publisher": ["Zoch Verlag"], "description": "A dexterity game where players take turning loading wooden &quot;stuff&quot; onto a swaying wooden ship.

Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving?&#10;&#10;Each chapter is a mini-game and a variety of mechanics are required to complete them, from RPG-style skill tests for an individual character, to push-your-luck dice rolling as a team, to the playing of item cards collected along the way to bolster the tactical abilities of the group.&#10; &#10;When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy.

Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city&mdash;and the Renaissance period&mdash;even if he was only in Florence for a short time.

Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&rsquo;t know.

The various inhabitants of the planets in this solar system are launching one last effort to save themselves, which involves building a final Ark to propel a small selection of their people into deep space. This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself. In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds.&#10;&#10;Sol: Last Days of a Star is a board game for one to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark so they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!&#10;&#10;The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next.&#10;&#10;You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Space Cadets", "rank": "1427", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.270\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.62\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3084\t\t", "name": "Space Cadets", "year": "2012", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Geoff Engelstein", "category": ["Action / Dexterity", "Puzzle", "Real-time", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "mechanic": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Flicking", "Grid Movement", "Memory", "Modular Board", "Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition", "Programmed Movement", "Push Your Luck", "Re-rolling and Locking", "Real-Time", "Set Collection"], "publisher": ["Stronghold Games", "Asmodee"], "description": "It's your lifelong dream &ndash; to join the Star Patrol and be part of the crew of an interstellar Starship.

Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) &#10;    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) &#10;    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) &#10;    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) &#10;    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) &#10;    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) &#10;    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)&#10;&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.&#10;&#10;It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin?

Each player takes the role of a foreman - the manager of a mining team. During the game, players will try to extract salt most efficiently from the mine, sell their &quot;white gold&quot; at the market, and above all complete the king's salt orders. The player who earns the most money from extracting salt receives the title of Royal Steward and wins the game.&#10;&#10;(From the rulebook)&#10;&#10;Magnum Sal is latin name that Wieliczka was noted in some documents for the first time - it means Great Salt.

The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power. To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That's why it is so important to have one's family members in the right place at the right time &ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one's goals.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive).&#10;    Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.&#10;    Travel to Florence where you'll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.&#10;    Introduce a new family member to the board.&#10;    Raise all lying family members on the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the &quot;Power of the Medici&quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles. Certain actions require you to remove such a tile, and the game ends when they're all gone. Players then sum their power points &ndash; earned for gained tiles and majorities in the regions and Florence &ndash; for a final scoring, and the player with the most power wins.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Circle the Wagons", "rank": "1462", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.256\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.23\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1064\t\t", "name": "Circle the Wagons", "year": "2017", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "15", "max_time": "15", "designer": "Steven Aramini", "category": ["American West", "Card Game", "City Building"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Melding and Splaying", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "publisher": ["Button Shy", "Quined Games", "Salt & Pepper Games"], "description": "Each player in Circle the Wagons is fixin' to build up their own boomtown, but only one'll build the best in the West!&#10;&#10;Blaze a trail by draftin' cards 'round the circle and placin' 'em in yer town, tryin' to connect matchin' territories to score prosperity points!

Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour.

Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns.

The mummy wins when it earns a certain number of life points, while the tomb raiders have to secure a certain amount of treasures. &#10;Ravensburger states that bluffing and memory also play a big part in this game.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 magnetic game board, 1 magnetic mummy figure (2 pieces), 4 magnetic treasure hunters (tomb raiders), 12 life points, 5 treasure hunter dice, 1 Mummy die, 23 mission cards, 2 cover tiles.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Carcassonne: Amazonas", "rank": "1472", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.251\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.13\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1172\t\t", "name": "Carcassonne: Amazonas", "year": "2016", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "35", "max_time": "35", "designer": "Klaus-J\u00fcrgen Wrede", "category": ["Animals", "Exploration", "Territory Building"], "mechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Tile Placement"], "publisher": ["999 Games", "Fantasmagoria", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Giochi Uniti", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Hobby World", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "In Carcassonne: Amazonas, players sail their boats to the Amazon to discover abundant wildlife.

At the start of play, you receive a number of Province cards at random, then mark your initial positions with town pieces. Shuffle these Province cards with a set of five Initial cards to form your starting deck, then draw a hand of five cards. The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game.&#10;&#10;Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card. The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels. Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads. As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play.&#10;&#10;On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards. Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province. To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses.&#10;&#10;Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards. Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource. You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve. You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces. Castles increase the defensive value of a province.&#10;&#10;All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province. Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card. For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the &quot;Roadside Inns&quot; VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP. You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters. The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "DungeonQuest (third edition)", "rank": "1481", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.247\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.64\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3050\t\t", "name": "DungeonQuest (third edition)", "year": "2010", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Jakob Bonds", "category": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "mechanic": ["Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Arclight", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Stratelibri"], "description": "DungeonQuest is a re-imagining of the classic board game of dungeon exploration for 1-4 players.

The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.&#10;&#10;Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.&#10;&#10;Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder.  The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&rsquo;s rating for the current &ldquo;search&rdquo;.  There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched.  These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations.  So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.&#10;&#10;Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn they draw an event card.  These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city.  Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime!  These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur.  Some of them have &ldquo;unknown circumstance&rdquo; tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.&#10;&#10;If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed.  Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.&#10;&#10;So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.&#10;&#10;Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token.  These tokens can later be used to help with tasks.  However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances.  The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for.  If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.&#10;&#10;To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.

The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player's contribution to the growing urban area.

Having a simple-to-learn strategic system and short rulebook, The Napoleonic Wars, can be played in an evening as the cards and Diplomatic Track make for tough decision-making in the face of everchanging enemy threats.&#10;&#10;Set in 1805 Europe, you must weigh the strategic dilemmas facing the two alliances in mortal conflict. Napoleon's France enjoys a superb army, central position, superior leadership, and a useful, if not powerful, ally in Spain. However, she faces three foes.&#10;&#10;Napoleon must beware of Britain's seapower and wealth, Austria's threatening position, and Russia's reinforcing hordes. In the wings, Prussia, Turkey, and Sweden teeter on the brink of war, begging inducements to join either side. Even lowly Denmark's fleet can upset the balance of power.&#10;&#10;When fleets or armies collide, battle-related cards may be played and then dice are rolled to resolve the battle and inflict casualties. Even the most brilliant maneuver faces the chance of floundering. So play The Napoleonic Wars now, and put the strategist in you to the test.

This is the age of knights and squires, where chivalry is often spoken of, but rarely practiced. It is a time of both religion and superstition. Educated clerics fervently believe that angels guard the pious, and demons scourge the wicked, while the simpler folk watch the night for signs of werewolves and dragons. The game assumes that all of these are real.&#10;&#10;Joan of Arc is a story-driven board game that uses finely-sculpted miniatures and 3D scenery to set the scene for a game of cunning and skill (and a little luck). The game is a combination of interwoven card play, resource management, and position on the board. You will need to master all three to beat the best opponents. Getting your men into the right position, and heading off your enemy, will be no use if you cannot muster the cards and other resources to make the most of it. Joan of Arc allows a huge amount of freedom in your actions. In every turn, you can choose to spend or save resources, and when you come to activate a unit you can choose between combat, interrogation, search, exploration, prayers, and other actions. So, this turn, should you level up a hero, or spend that resource to buy a re-roll? Take extra actions now, or save them for later? Double-move that cavalry, or question the old woman in the woods? When and how to act are decisions you must make based on your objectives, and the situation on the board. And, what is the best decision one turn may be very different in the next.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of the various factions in the war, or of some of the supernatural creatures that have emerged from the shadows. The most famous heroes and heroines of the war are all here: the Black Prince, the Dauphin, Falstaff, and, of course, Joan of Arc herself. Each game is a unique scenario with its own map assembled from the gaming tiles, and a specified set of heroes and followers to achieve the scenario&rsquo;s objectives. Each scenario has its own victory conditions, often different for each side. In one game you may be an inquisitor, seeking out a werewolf hidden among the peasantry; in another you may be a victorious raiding party, desperately fighting your way through an ambush so you can return to the safety of your castle.&#10;&#10;Scenarios range from small affairs with a few models and simplified role-play elements, to full battles with dozens of knights, archers and men-at-arms. All scenarios typically play in under an hour. The game also includes a battle mode, to fight out conflicts between armies of your choosing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "LYNGK", "rank": "1523", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.233\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.66\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t719\t\t", "name": "LYNGK", "year": "2017", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "60", "designer": "Kris Burm", "category": ["Abstract Strategy"], "mechanic": [], "publisher": ["HUCH!", "Rebel", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "LYNGK is a synthesis of the first six games of the GIPF Project.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 48 pieces in six colors.

At 30 minutes per session, gameplay is fast-paced and down to the wire.  In this game, players take on the role of Harry Dresden and his allies, investigating cases and taking on foes from the books. To accomplish this, you'll share a common pool of action points (called Fate points), and each player must choose between taking an action or generating Fate points each turn. Solve more cases than there are foes left standing to win!&#10;&#10;In short, each player plays a character from the novels (one of them is always Harry), taking on a shuffled scenario deck based on one of the books in the series. Using a combination of cards, dice, and teamwork, players attack foes, investigate cases, take advantages, and overcome obstacles to make sure they have the best possible odds for a win in the final showdown at the end of the book!

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed.

The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?&#10;&#10;Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a &quot;bulge&quot; in the American line.&#10;&#10;Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.&#10;&#10;The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the &quot;Bulge enthusiast&quot; and the casual player will enjoy.

Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&#10;&#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&#10;&#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&#10;&#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Nightfall: Martial Law&#10;    Nightfall: Blood Country&#10;    Nightfall: The Coldest War&#10;    Nightfall: Dark Rages&#10;    Nightfall: Eastern Skies&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Cinque Terre", "rank": "1544", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.224\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.03\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1214\t\t", "name": "Cinque Terre", "year": "2013", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "60", "designer": "Chris Handy", "category": ["Farming", "Transportation"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Set Collection"], "publisher": ["Rio Grande Games"], "description": "The Cinque Terre are five coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy known for their beauty, culture, food, and proximity to one another. Produce carts are commonly found in each village marketplace.&#10;&#10;In Cinque Terre, a game of strategy, players compete to sell the most valuable produce in the five villages. Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Set Up and Play&#10;&#10;During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&#10;     Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&#10;     Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&#10;     Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Constantinopolis", "rank": "1545", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.223\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.92\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1446\t\t", "name": "Constantinopolis", "year": "2010", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Giancarlo Fioretti", "category": ["City Building", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Nautical", "Transportation"], "mechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation"], "publisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Homo Ludens", "Stratelibri"], "description": "In the 6th century A.D., ruled by Emperor Iustinianus (commonly called 'Justinian'), Constantinopolis was the largest emporium in the East Roman 'Byzantine' Empire.

In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order&#10;&#10;In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.&#10;&#10;Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.&#10;&#10;A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.&#10;&#10;In comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "N\u0113t\u0101-Tanka: Deluxe Edition", "rank": "1548", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.223\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.36\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t906\t\t", "name": "N\u0113t\u0101-Tanka: Deluxe Edition", "year": "2019", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Herv\u00e9 Rigal", "category": ["Civilization"], "mechanic": ["Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "publisher": ["La Bo\u00eete de Jeu"], "description": "The Kickstarter edition and Kickstarter Deluxe edition both come with exclusive components not found in the retail edition including 5th player components (retail supports up to 4 players) and the mountain expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Frostrivers tribe dwells along the Great Frozen River.

During this ceremony, each clan presents a young leader who will need to demonstrate generosity and the ability to provide for the tribe in order to become the new Neta-Tanka.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;When it is your turn, place a worker on the board. All the players place their workers, one at the time, until everybody has placed all their workers.&#10;&#10;Then, in the order of the turn, the players trigger all their workers.&#10;&#10;Think ahead, because some actions require other actions to be triggered beforehand! For example, if you want to get pelts, the &quot;Hunt&quot; action must have been triggered earlier in the turn. And when you skin the game to get the pelts, then the meat becomes available for the other players. It is crucial to remember the turn's order when you place your workers, or they might have nothing to do when you resolve your actions!&#10;&#10;Another key point of the game is that the spots on the board are linked with each other. Triggering 2 actions that are linked with each other gives you a boost (by improving those actions, or giving you extra resources, ...).&#10;&#10;There are different ways of scoring points in the game.

Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &#10;&#10;     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &#10;     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &#10;     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;There are more differences that are non-substantive.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.&#10;&#10;The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.&#10;&#10;Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition", "rank": "1551", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.222\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.14\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1347\t\t", "name": "Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition", "year": "2014", "min_players": "5", "max_players": "75", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Ted Alspach", "category": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Horror", "Murder/Mystery", "Negotiation", "Party Game"], "mechanic": ["Player Elimination", "Role Playing", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "publisher": ["B\u00e9zier Games", "Siam Board Games"], "description": "Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: Villagers and Werewolves.

To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Luckily for you, Shadowrift is a deck-building game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck, cards that will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes. Unlike other deck-builders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer their coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.&#10;&#10;Shadowrift also features monsters that don't merely sit waiting to be slain; if you leave them alone, they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful). For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Shadowrift features many improved mechanisms, including a revised system for how monsters choose who to attack (based on types of villagers, instead of specific people) and a new system for monster powers (making them much more dangerous).

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Spades", "rank": "1559", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.219\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.75\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1929\t\t", "name": "Spades", "year": "1938", "min_players": "4", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "60", "designer": "(Uncredited)", "category": ["Card Game"], "mechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Team-Based Game", "Trick-taking"], "publisher": ["(Public Domain)", "Fundex"], "description": "This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.

The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.&#10;&#10;There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.&#10;&#10;When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.&#10;&#10;When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.&#10;&#10;Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).&#10;&#10;Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.

This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.&#10;&#10;During the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.&#10;&#10;Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.&#10;&#10;Historically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.&#10;&#10;This game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control.

A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play.

At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish.  The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Design Notes&#10;&#10;Lords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence.  The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion.  During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last.  Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage.

Pendragon &ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.&#10;&#10;Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:&#10;&#10;Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens.&#10;Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.&#10;Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.&#10;Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ.&#10;Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics.&#10;Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control.&#10;Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation.&#10;Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes.&#10;Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.&#10;Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms.&#10;A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.&#10;Short, medium, and full-length scenarios&#10;Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.&#10;&#10;Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:&#10;&#10;The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.&#10;&#10;The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&mdash;materially or culturally&mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.&#10;&#10;The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&mdash;whoever their paymaster&mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.&#10;&#10;The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority.

The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.

The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.&#10;&#10;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have.

Communist movements have sprung up throughout Europe. Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin plan to blast through Poland in order to support the red revolutions in Germany, France and England. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Strike of the Eagle models the battles and historical events of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.&#10;&#10;To simulate the tension of the era from the fog of war, players alternate placing secret orders on their armies in order to bluff, mislead and misdirect their opponents. These concealed orders make it difficult to deduce an opponent's plans and are used to hide a player's true intentions and objectives. Players then reveal and resolve the issued orders. They can then disrupt their opponent's moves, cut off supply and much more. Once orders are resolved the next turn begins.&#10;&#10;Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, but with a simple and quick combat system.&#10;&#10;Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle's resolution.[...]&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.&#10;&#10;The map portrays a portion of Eastern Europe in 1920. It is divided into areas that are named after local cities to simplify scenario setups. Along the outer edge of the map is a grid to help find areas during game setup. Each area name is followed by its grid location.&#10;The map is divided into two fronts; the northern and the southern. The front line is designated by a yellow line that runs from east to west. In 4 player scenarios, each allied player commands blocks on one front only. If a block of one player crosses the line between fronts, it moves to the control of his ally at the beginning of the next Operation Phase.&#10;&#10;The Fog of War series is a card driven game where Divisions and Brigades are represented as blocks. These blocks stand upright during the game to prevent opponents from knowing their strength or unit type and can only be revealed during combat or through Recon Area orders given during each Operation Phase.&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle is divided into a number of Rounds, each Round being subdivided into a number of identical phases. The Round Phase Track marks the game's progression. Each round is divided into the Replenish Cards Phase, five identical Operation Phases, and a Reinforcement Phase.&#10;Each side has a pool of order counters to draw from. These order counters represent the various types of orders each unit or group may be given. These orders, which range from Forced Marches to Reconnaissance actions, allow the player to strategically manouver his Divisions and Brigades. Orders are placed face down, leading to guesswork and strategic anticipation on the part of your opponent!&#10;&#10;The sequence of placing and executing orders is determined by the player(s) with the higher initiative. Each front has its own initiative track. Initiative is gained and lost as the game progresses. Whether to place first or second is an important strategic element of the game!&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle is a card driven game. Each card is broken up into a number of different parts and each card can be played for either its event as listed in the body of the card, to increase the number of orders available in a phase (uppermost left), for the combat value on the card (uppermost right), or for reinforcements (lowermost left).&#10;&#10;Supply is important in Stike of the Eagle. If units are out of supply they will fight less well, take much greater losses, and lose the advantage of any Garrison which might be located at their city.&#10;&#10;(from Academy Games website)&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Drako: Dragon & Dwarves", "rank": "1623", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.195\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.69\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2021\t\t", "name": "Drako: Dragon & Dwarves", "year": "2011", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Adam Ka\u0142u\u017ca", "category": ["Fantasy", "Fighting"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Rebel", "Dast Work srl", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Pegasus Spiele", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "Drako: Dragon &amp; Dwarves is an asymmetrical game for two players, with one player leading a team of three dwarves who are experienced dragon hunters and the other playing a red dragon that has spread terror amongst local peasants.

One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.&#10;&#10;At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &quot;Adios, Amigoes!&quot;, &quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&quot;, and &quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&quot;, &quot;He shot my hat clean off!&quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &quot;Fire at will, boys.&quot;&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.&#10;&#10;Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&quot;&#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.&#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.&#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.&#10;&#10;Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &quot;Kittens&quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "El Gaucho", "rank": "1626", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.194\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.83\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1489\t\t", "name": "El Gaucho", "year": "2014", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "60", "designer": "Arve D.

Be smart and get in your opponents&rsquo; way with mean tricks by snatching the most valuable cattle from under their noses, or swing your lasso to abduct one of their animals. At home, sort your cattle by race and assemble them in herds only to sell them later for as many Pesos as possible.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect sets of cattle tiles and sell them. Each cattle tile has a value and a race. A set contains only tiles of the same race, ordered in ascending or descending value. For each race, your cattle tiles are arranged in a line. New cattle tiles are added to the end of the line. When you add a tile that doesn't match the ordering of the existing set, that means that set ends and a new set is started.&#10;&#10;Obtaining cattle is done through a worker placement system. Each player has seven Gauchos which can be placed on various action spaces. The most important of these is the Pampa, where Gauchos can catch cattle (which means the player gains a new cattle tile). Other actions include stealing cattle from other players and sorting your cattle (to optimize your sets).&#10;&#10;Placing the Gauchos on an action space requires dice. Each action requires a specific value. These dice are taken from the Dice Rodeo. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled. During his turn, a player takes two dice from the Dice Rodeo and uses them to place his Gauchos.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each completed set of cattle is sold. The game ends when the cattle tiles draw pile runs out. When this happens, one more round is played, and then all cattle tiles are sold.

Once you have built a line you must acquire second hand engines and rolling stock to move the goods and passengers that your line connects to. Such a line quickly becomes unprofitable and it pays to have one of the two major companies take it over from you.&#10;&#10;Building track can also be made more difficult by local residents who object to railways being built on their land.

That wait is now over!&#10;As the director of a small railway company who has inveigled investment money from gullible locals, it's up to you to see if you can actually make a profit from building track amongst some of the most difficult terrain in England. There's stone to be moved from quarries, and cheese to be moved to market. You might also find the odd passenger who wants to travel to civilization.&#10;&#10;However, standing in your way is the local farmer, who really does not want you to build on his land. Fortunately you can buy favours from the necessary government committee to deal with such irritations. You will also need a few contacts with other train companies, as you will need their second-hand engines to run on your lines. Finally, once you've sucked all the profit that you can from a route, you must off-load it to a major train company before you are saddled with the losses.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "First Train to Nuremberg", "rank": "1631", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.190\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.11\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1011\t\t", "name": "First Train to Nuremberg", "year": "2010", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Martin Wallace", "category": ["Trains", "Transportation"], "mechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Network and Route Building", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Set Collection"], "publisher": ["Argentum Verlag", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "During the second third of the 19th century, a rapid development of railway transport got under way. All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.&#10; First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).&#10;&#10;With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so.

The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.

Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organize a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.&#10;&#10;One player takes charge of the Soviet forces trying to shape the headlines to his liking and uses the militia and snipers of the State Protection Authority to stop the revolutionaries at all cost. The other player(s) (from 1-3 opponents) co-operatively play as the ringleaders of the revolutionary forces collecting resources (represented as icons on their cards) and recruiting other fighters to ensure the revolution's events end up in favor of their side, while fighting off tanks and soldiers in this exciting, historically inspired card driven game.&#10;&#10;Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is played over seven days &mdash; the last week of October 1956. The Soviet commander plays headline cards at the beginning of every turn, gathering Command Points and triggering effects that sometimes help, sometimes hinder the revolutionary effort. This card-play, reminiscent of well-known card-driven wargames (CDG) such as Twilight Struggle or Labyrinth: War on Terror, is what drives the tempo and the strategic thrust of the game. The other player(s) form the revolutionary side. They collect cards and fighters for two reasons: to resolve events for boosts to their side, and to fight off militia, snipers, and Soviet tanks in a drastic fight for survival. They have to manage their positions while spreading across Budapest, carefully dividing their actions as a team and always keeping an eye on their morale lest they run out of cards. This team-playing aspect &mdash; reminiscent of highly successful cooperative games such as Pandemic &mdash; guarantees ease of access to players who would otherwise be more intimidated by a traditional CDG.&#10;&#10;If any of the revolutionary ringleaders suffer too many wounds, or if they fail to resolve enough events by the end of the game, history changes and the revolution falls. But if they keep the streets of Budapest free from oppression, the revolution lives on, to fight another day.&#10;&#10;Historical Note: In real life, the revolution succeeded, and Hungary was free for less than a week.

Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.&#10;&#10;The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman's ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.&#10;&#10;Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map; the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps.&#10;&#10;The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax.&#10;&#10;Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle.&#10;&#10;The game's basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region's Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit's region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available.&#10;&#10;Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals.&#10;&#10;Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General's Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards.&#10;&#10;Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses).&#10;&#10;The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn.&#10;&#10;For those players who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided. Now players can use Dutch squadrons to blockade the King, summon the Duke of Lorraine, or cause a rising in London.

The rules are intricate, and there are many factors for players to deal with: resources, unit production, negotiation, and, of course, strategic warfare.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Hera and Zeus", "rank": "1666", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.181\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.50\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t3198\t\t", "name": "Hera and Zeus", "year": "2000", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Richard Borg", "category": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Mythology"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "publisher": ["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal.

However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards.

Instead of cards, dice give you the beans that you must use to satisfy orders and (eventually) collect &quot;Bohnentalers&quot; (i.e., dollars, bucks, dinero...). The first player to collect thirteen Bohnentalers wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows six orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &ndash; say, two specific bean types or three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &ndash; requiring, say, a four-of-a-kind or seven beans with no blue ones &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the seven bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and four of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then she rerolls any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, she completes as many orders as she can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a standalone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Hands in the Sea", "rank": "1694", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.173\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.89\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t531\t\t", "name": "Hands in the Sea", "year": "2016", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Daniel Berger (I)", "category": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Wargame"], "mechanic": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Point to Point Movement"], "publisher": ["Knight Works, LLC"], "description": "Hands in the Sea is a two-player deck building wargame on the First Punic War, between Rome and Carthage, 264&ndash;241 BC.&#10;&#10;Each player has a starting deck of cards they use to perform various actions, up to two per round.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!&#10;&#10;Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).&#10;&#10;Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.&#10;&#10;Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).&#10;&#10;The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.&#10;&#10;All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &quot;do you develop your grain productivity &ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).&#10;&#10;When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).&#10;&#10;Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Nautilion", "rank": "1697", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.172\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.28\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t834\t\t", "name": "Nautilion", "year": "2016", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "15", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Shadi Torbey", "category": ["Dice", "Fantasy", "Nautical"], "mechanic": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "publisher": ["Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Nautilion is a dice game in the Oniverse series!&#10;&#10;Take the helm of a Nautilion submarine and recruit a heroic crew to vanquish the treacherous Darkhouse that lurks in the oceanic depths.

The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of four phases:&#10;&#10;Each round starts with the Event phase, in which a random event may occur that affects all players.&#10;&#10;The next phase is the Supply phase.

One of the players, the Trade Master, determines how many resource cards (2, 3 or 4) each player must offer for trade. The player that offers the resources with the highest value becomes the new Trade Master. He chooses one of the resources offered by one of the other players, and adds it to his hand, or exchanges it with a card from the market (three face-up cards that are available for such exchanges). Then, the player that he has taken a card from gets to take a card, and so on, until all the cards have been taken.&#10;&#10;Finally, during the Progression phase, the players exchange their resources for doubloons and developments. A player may exchange one set of three or more of the same resource for a development.

Of course, none of this building can be done without money, so sometimes players must take time out to earn some money so they can afford to continue their building projects.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea medium box series.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "The Rise of Queensdale", "rank": "1727", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.163\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.58\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t650\t\t", "name": "The Rise of Queensdale", "year": "2018", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "60", "designer": "Inka Brand", "category": ["Civilization", "Medieval"], "mechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Legacy Game", "Worker Placement"], "publisher": ["alea", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "description": "&quot;Build me a castle!

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle.

The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.&#10;&#10;A play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If he wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on &#10;&#10;     type of game announced&#10;     combination of Jacks&#10;     margin of winning (score 90+: &quot;schneider&quot;; take all tricks: &quot;schwarz&quot;)&#10;     (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played &#10;     (optional) open play of cards&#10;     (optional) play with the initial hand (&quot;hand&quot; play)&#10;     (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 (&quot;Kontra&quot;); re-doubling *4 (&quot;Re&quot;); inofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum&#10;     exeption for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick (&quot;virgin&quot;), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied (&quot;geschoben&quot;); a player may also try to &quot;shoot the moon&quot; by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The solo player can choose between the following game modes:&#10;&#10;     Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)&#10;     Grand (only Jacks are trumps)&#10;     Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks). &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Inofficial variants:&#10;&#10;     The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraorinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.&#10;     Revolution (in three variants): bascially a Null in open play, but the counterplayers are allowed to exchange cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Skat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many inofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called &quot;trench rules&quot; later became officially sanctioned.&#10;&#10;The official turnament deck is a compomise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth", "rank": "1733", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.159\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.33\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t865\t\t", "name": "Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth", "year": "2012", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "2", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Chris Dupuis", "category": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "publisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "description": "Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth is a card-driven skirmish game played on modular interlocking map tiles that uses order cards, creature cards and miniatures.

With the exception of the 0-value gangsters, a player normally needs two identical gangsters (same family and same value) to be able to take a gangster with the next highest value of the same family. When a player does this, they place one of the smaller gangsters from their hand into their play area. To get higher-valued gangsters faster, the player may use the special abilities of the different families at the cost of placing more gangsters in their play area.

The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.

Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.&#10;&#10;After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.&#10;&#10;Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.&#10;&#10;David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.

TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game.

The battlefield is a cityscape (poster map) with building models integral to the game's strategy and gameplay. The game uses dice pools of custom dice that are used for both attacking and taking actions, leading to an ebb and flow between monster and unit turns. The goal for both players is to eliminate the monster on the opposing side.&#10;&#10;Monsterpocalypse launched as a CMG in Fall 2008 with the 'Rise' block which consisted of a base set ('Rise') and two expansion sets ('I Chomp NY' and 'All Your Base'), both of which were released in 2009. The second block was released in Fall 2009 with the base set ('Now') and an expansion set ('Big in Japan') in 2010. The last expansion for the 'Now' block has still not been released as of 2015.&#10;&#10;Each set contains large-scale monsters, as well as smaller support units and interactive buildings. Figures were sold in semi-randomized starter packs and randomized booster packs, with limited figures available only through promotional events.&#10;&#10;In 2010 Privateer Press released the Monsterpocalypse 2 Player Battle Box, a semi-randomised set which contained everything 2 players needed to dive right into the game, including two full factions and a complete set of buildings (all from Set 1 'Rise'). In 2011 they also released Monsterpocalypse Dangerous Monster Zone or Monsterpocalypse DMZ for short. These worked as expansion packs for the 2 Player Battle Box, each containing completely fixed, faction specific sets of Set 2 'I Chomp NY' and 3 'All Your Base' miniatures. By buying the DMZs for the factions you got in your  initial battle box you would have 2 complete factions and a full set of buildings from the 'Rise' block, making Monsterpocalypse  much more accessible for newer players in a more non-collectible format.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Space Cadets: Away Missions", "rank": "1757", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.151\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.46\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t701\t\t", "name": "Space Cadets: Away Missions", "year": "2015", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "6", "min_time": "60", "max_time": "120", "designer": "Dan Raspler", "category": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "mechanic": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Stronghold Games"], "description": "Long before the threat of the Nemesis, before the perils of warp drive or the founding of our own Space Academy, humanity experienced a Golden Age of space exploration.

The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;History&#10;The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.&#10;&#10;The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.&#10;Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Big Two&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Masons", "rank": "1760", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.149\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.53\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2361\t\t", "name": "Masons", "year": "2006", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "45", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Leo Colovini", "category": ["City Building", "Medieval"], "mechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "publisher": ["999 Games", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "In Masons, players represent architects, who together establish cities on the landscape of the game board.

Each wall will be enclosed by two towers, and will have one house placed on each side of it. It's possible for a wall to need only one, or zero, new towers by putting it next to existing towers. It's possible for only one house to be placed, if the wall is placed along the outside of the game board.&#10;After placing the wall, the player rolls three dice to determine the color of one of the towers (the color of a possible second tower may be freely chosen), and that of the two houses (if only one house is placed, then the player may choose which of the dice to pick for the color of the house).&#10;Finally, if the newly placed wall causes a piece of land to be fully enclosed, a new city has been established. If the new city borders one or more existing cities, it may be combined with one of those cities. Two houses of the same color inside the city are upgraded to a palace. A scoring round is now triggered, during which all players get to play one or two &quot;guild cards&quot;, and then draw one new card. Each guild card will score a feature of either the just completed city, or outside it. Possible features are the number of houses &amp; palaces or towers of a specified color, the number of fields of the city, the number of houses inside a &quot;district&quot; on the board, the number of palaces inside a city, the different number of colors inside a city, or the total number of completed cities.

Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.&#10;&#10;The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.&#10;&#10;As a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined).

Deep beneath the crust, the oceans are teeming with alien sea life. Shellfish, plants, corals, arthropods, even strange fish and larger sea creatures populate a wide-ranging interconnected web of hidden seas. Volcanism is rampant, warming the mineral-rich waters and creating excellent conditions for energy-harvesting.&#10;&#10;The largest cavern close to the surface is known as The Pocket. This is where the initial teams of Stabilizers built their first outposts, with the intent to establish long-term communities capable of surviving indefinitely. Aqua-farming is well established; food and other sundries are efficiently gathered. The Pocket has many deposits of minerals and crystals that can be mined and processed to create strong and versatile construction materials locally.&#10;&#10;Colonists arrive at the Doorstep at regular intervals when the Threshold is opened. The arrivals are of four general types: Pioneers (who are tasked with exploring the changing surface of the moon and the labyrinth of seas beneath), Engineers (who develop and operate the machinery and structures needed to run the colonies), Marines (who defend the colonies from hostile sea life, unwanted intruders, and other colonies), and Stewards (overseers responsible for strategy and negotiation).&#10;&#10;Colony development mostly occurs beneath the ice; this is where all of the moon&rsquo;s resources are concentrated, so this is where the effort is best spent. To keep close to the surface, most colony structures are built clinging onto the underside of the ice crust. Surface structures will be built only once an undersea outpost is well established and beginning to thrive. In addition to construction and resource-gathering, colonies spend a lot of effort on exploring this new environment. The volcanic action and mineral-heavy waters make long-range scanning unreliable, so physical exploration is required to plumb the depths.&#10;&#10;As the Pocket is explored and expanded, the established colonies have been making some unusual discoveries beneath the ice. Deep in the trenches, artifacts of non-human origin are starting to be found. The dark seas hide many secrets. Squads of mercenaries occasionally appear on the surface and beneath the sea, penetrating the Threshold somehow to carry out an unknown mission on the moon. These aspects are worrisome but can&rsquo;t distract the colonies from their main goals.&#10;&#10;It is still early in the Artemis project. A foothold on life here has been gained, but it will take tenacious effort from the competing colonies to reach the point where Europa is truly viable as a home.&#10;&#10;The Artemis Project is a dice (dis)placement and engine building game that has you fighting the planet as well as the other players.

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...&#10;&#10;In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)&#10;&#10;At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).&#10;&#10;For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.&#10;&#10;When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation.

Victory points are earned in three ways: first, each card purchased is worth one or more victory points; second, victory points can be gained by defeating monsters with a power resource featured on several of the cards; and third, some cards give victory points directly each time they are played.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "7 Ages", "rank": "1795", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.137\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.06\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1001\t\t", "name": "7 Ages", "year": "2004", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "7", "min_time": "480", "max_time": "480", "designer": "Harry Rowland", "category": ["Civilization", "Wargame"], "mechanic": ["Area Movement", "Simulation", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Australian Design Group"], "description": "7 Ages is a game of world history from 4000 BC/E to 2000 AD/CE.

Each card also has a numeric value, used for making bids and trading. The game also features a system of a limited number of action options per player based on chits secretly selected by players each turn -- for example, if you are playing more than one civilization, only one can declare war, only one can take production, etc. There is a &quot;wild&quot; chit each player can use to let two of his or her civilizations take the same action, but the civilization using the wild chit pays a penalty.&#10;&#10;Victory points and civilization levels are plotted using an on-board scoring area.

There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression.  This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something.  You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops.  Their goal is to fire and maneuver.  Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close.  The system itself forces this realistic play.  In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;The game is the first in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is a stand alone game that is set on the Eastern Front and follows the German 11th Panzer (Ghost) Division&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Catan: Portable Edition", "rank": "1797", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.137\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.79\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1419\t\t", "name": "Catan: Portable Edition", "year": "2002", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Klaus Teuber", "category": ["City Building", "Civilization", "Negotiation"], "mechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Trading"], "publisher": ["999 Games", "Capcom Co., Ltd.", "danspil", "GP Games", "Hanayama", "KOSMOS", "Mayfair Games"], "description": "Settlers of Catan Travel Edition is, as the name says, a Travel Edition of The Settlers of Catan. &#10;The rules of the game are the same, but there are some changes between the two editions: &#10;&#10;    No Expansions: In the Travel Edition it is not possible to add any expansions to the regular game, so it is a 3 or 4 players game only. &#10;    Pre-determined Desert location: The hex containing the Desert is always in the middle of the board. &#10;    Pre-determined numbers: The numbers for production are in fixed locations on the board.

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Fuji Flush", "rank": "1811", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.131\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.56\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1996\t\t", "name": "Fuji Flush", "year": "2016", "min_players": "3", "max_players": "8", "min_time": "10", "max_time": "20", "designer": "Friedemann Friese", "category": ["Card Game", "Number"], "mechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "publisher": ["2F-Spiele", "Arclight", "Edge Entertainment", "Giochi Uniti", "Stronghold Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "Be the first player to get rid of all of your cards!&#10;&#10;Join forces with fellow players to beat cards played by other players...or independently play the highest card to outdo all your opponents together, flushing their cards down the drain!&#10;&#10;Fuji Flush is a fast, fun, easy-to-learn card game that will have you shouting as your cards are sent down the drain!&#10;&#10;Fuji Flush is a card game, which consists of cards numbered 2 through 20, with higher numbers being rarer.

Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.&#10;&#10;Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "The Fury of Dracula", "rank": "1839", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.120\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.92\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1139\t\t", "name": "The Fury of Dracula", "year": "1987", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "180", "max_time": "180", "designer": "Stephen Hand", "category": ["Adventure", "Deduction", "Fighting", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "mechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Devir", "Games Workshop Ltd.", "Oriflam", "Sfera", "Shadow Games and Fantasy, Inc."], "description": "The premise of The Fury of Dracula is very similar to Scotland Yard, but with additional rules for combat, events, and encounters.

Bombers unleash a downpour of destruction on the Finnish capital of Helsinki. In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence.&#10;&#10;Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...&#10;&#10;Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.  The design focuses foremost on playability, with low counter  density, concise rules, and sleek, simple mechanics that combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes.  This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.

FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.&#10;&#10;Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.&#10;&#10;FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. &#10;&#10;&#10;Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play.

Set in the Dystopian Universe, players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team&rsquo;s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanism gives you total control of your strategy.&#10;&#10;Grifters is all about stealing as much money as you can from the corrupt government, malicious corporations, and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of six Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of six Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each specialist has a special ability and skill. On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job. This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise, earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play.&#10;&#10;Grifters uses a unique card &quot;cooldown&quot; system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first &quot;Night&quot; of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout.&#10;&#10;When a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting.

Any other player may challenge the Informant. When challenged, the active player reveals the card that was played. If that card is the Informant, the challenger must give the active player 2M ISK. If that card is not the Informant, no payments are due from any player to the active player, the challenger steals 2M ISK from the active player and gets to take the action on the card that was played.&#10;&#10;Informants are a really fun addition to the game and totally fitting with the Dystopian Universe.&#10;&#10;A set of these promo specialist cards.&#10;&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #1: 3 x The Security Specialist promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #2: 3 x Crooked Warden promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #3: 3 x Veteran promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #4: 3 x Underboss promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #5: 3 x Negotiator promo&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Heart of Crown", "rank": "1850", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.119\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t7.68\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t611\t\t", "name": "Heart of Crown", "year": "2011", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "4", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "60", "designer": "ginkgo", "category": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["FLIPFLOPs", "Hangom Games", "Japanime Games", "Japon Brand"], "description": "They were tough times, the days when swords and magic still ruled the world.

Players take turns during a round consisting of 3 actions each. During each turn, you may travel back in time, play a technology card from your hand, influence an existing technology, or draw two cards (keeping only one).&#10;&#10;As you travel back in time, Technologies are played from your hand by paying their discard cost. Any technologies you play generate influence for you automatically.&#10;&#10;Having more influence than your opponents is the key to claiming rewards for a technology! At the end of each round, rewards are given for each technology and its dependencies. One Influence cube from each technology will come off at the end of each round, forming your influence pool to be used in future rounds to influence existing technologies. Keep in mind, a technology is only considered successful if all of its dependencies exist previously on the timeline.&#10;&#10;Since there are several copies of each technology, you may be able to preempt and eliminate an existing copy by playing yours earlier in the timeline!  Be sure there is room for your new technology, though; each time-frame has a capacity equal to it's distance from the present.&#10;&#10;There are also a few rare but powerful Fate cards, each allowing you to break the rules in interesting ways. Fate cards have no discard cost and don't require an action to be played.&#10;&#10;By strategically influencing existing technologies, adapting to your opponents actions, and carefully choosing when to go further back in time, you will find yourself victorious over your rivals!

Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.&#10;&#10;Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &quot;rate&quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.&#10;&#10;This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes 300 individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.&#10;&#10;Included within the game are 17 historical scenarios ranging from the Battle of Minorca (1756) during the Seven Years War to the Battle of the Capes during the American Revolution and on through the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios using point values for each ship.

If a player plays a card, they score the cards points and check to see if their card has changed the state of the planet from hostile to habitable by checking the total habitable and hostile points played to the planet (some end game goals require planets to be hostile or habitable). The player may then draw a card from one of three decks, Low Evolution (cards that score less points but require less matter to play), High Evolution (cards that score more and are harder to play), and Final Evolution (cards that can only be played on a player's final turn).&#10;&#10;The thematics of the game have been developed with an eye on the science, led by a scientist working on NASA's search for life on Mars.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.&#10;&#10;Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.&#10;&#10;When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.&#10;&#10;Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.&#10;&#10;NOTE: this description is out-of-date.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Kingmaker", "rank": "1903", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.100\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.50\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2773\t\t", "name": "Kingmaker", "year": "1974", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "7", "min_time": "240", "max_time": "240", "designer": "Andrew McNeil", "category": ["Medieval", "Political", "Renaissance", "Wargame"], "mechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Voting"], "publisher": ["Ariel Productions Ltd", "The Avalon Hill Game Co", "Gibsons", "TM Games"], "description": "Kingmaker simulates the Wars of the Roses, the period of sporadic Civil War in England between 1450 and 1490.

A base point is the location of a pillar or junction constructed in previous turn. The height of the pillar must be 1 above or 1 below the base point. You may not construct a pillar of the same height, 2 stories above or below the height of a base point (following is an exception - 6.

To place a car,  your newest road must cross your opponent&rsquo;s road. There are two ways to cross your opponent&rsquo;s road: crossing over or crossing under it.&#10;&#10;When crossing over : &#10;there exist no other roads over opponent&rsquo;s road&#10;&#10;When crossing under : &#10;there exist no other roads under opponent&rsquo;s road&#10;&#10;When either of the conditions is met, you may place a car on the highway. If not, you may not place a car but may still connect the road to the next pillar.&#10;&#10;If the road crosses multiple roads, you may place multiple cars depending on the number of roads crossed.&#10;&#10;crossing over two roads at the same time&#10;crossing over and crossing under two roads at the same time&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;Caution&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187; You may not place a car when crossing over/under your own road.&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187; You may not place a car on already constructed roads later on in the game.&#10;Keep the traffic rules and enjoy driving!&#10;&#10;Constructing a Junction&#10;The yellow pillar is called the junction. Using a junction, you may do the following.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#160; Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number&#10;You may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.&#10;&#10;Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#161; Branching out to two-ways&#10;You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.&#10;&#10;Constructing Exit to Highway&#10;&#10;If you can ground a road safely to the table from a height of 1 pillar, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You cannot start a new road from the exit.&#10;&#10;Penalty&#10;&#10;If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;&#10;1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway&#10;The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.&#10;&#10;2.

Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud.

Give as good as you get in Bohnanza &ndash; Das Duell, there can be only one winner!&#10;&#10;How to play Bohnanza &ndash; Das Duell:&#10;Both duelists have bean field mats in front of themselves to plant their beans on. Between them, there is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three &ldquo;bo(h)nus cards&rdquo; with secret objectives. Playing the bean duel, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one you&rsquo;ve planted before, it has to have the next highest number than the one before. When harvesting your beans, it&rsquo;s the beanometer of the last card you&rsquo;ve planted that counts.&#10;At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand and turns over bean cards as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean type&rsquo;s gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they don&rsquo;t take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards.&#10;&ldquo;Bo(h)nus&rdquo; cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field. Fulfilling an objective earns you bean dollars and the brand new bean cents.

These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price.

Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price.&#10;&#10;At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders.

The players use sorcery to conjure minions, cast minions, and wield enchanted items to reach the game's goal of conquering three battlefields.&#10;&#10;The game uses a simple resource system of &quot;energy&quot; that is determined randomly by a dice-roll at the beginning of each round, to make sure no round is the same. However, the outcome being the same for both players, the game balance stays even. This energy is then used in the Action Phase for conjuring minions from your hand on any of three battlefields, casting possessions that can improve your minion's traits and abilities; or sorcery cards with various direct effects. Also as an action you can add more energy to your Energy Pool, draw more cards, move minions to another battlefield etc. The choice is yours, it is just about your pure skill to handle the battle preparation!&#10;&#10;In the Battle Phase players roll amount of custom dice equal to each minion's attack trait with possible outcome of miss, hit, double hit or critical hit for each die, and place damage counters on the respective minions or directly to the Battlefield. A unique system of Omen tokens then allows to adjust this outcome by re-rolling the dice, before distributing the damage among opponent's minions and battlefield.&#10;&#10;The combination of usual mechanics like story driven deck building, push your luck or dice-rolling; and a unique system of influencing the outcome of the battle, provides a perfect balance between strategy and random elements (even you still have the possibility to influence the outcome).

In August 2014, the first &ldquo;Print and Play&rdquo; demo version of Sorcerer was published, responding to all the remarks and feedback Peter Scholtz received, allowing him to create both his upgraded, native language demo and finally the, English language version of Sorcerer. The Sorcerer prototype was available for the wide audience as a free to play testing material over the year 2014. After another year of intense work and listening to the game community, Peter Scholtz went to Essen Spiel to meet some of the greatest board game publishers and show them the game. After a meeting with Rob Dougherty, CEO of the White Wizard Games, game designer (Star Realms, Hero Realms, and Epic card game), and last but not least, MTG Hall of Fame player, the dice was finally rolled.

There is no hidden information.&#10;&#10;2. There are no simultaneous decisions. Each decision happens sequentially.&#10;&#10;However, a dedicated Solitaire System is being released with Talon 1000. See the (GMT) Talon 1000 page for more information.&quot;&#10;BGG listing for Talon 1000.&#10;&#10;Designer:  Jim Krohn, Developer:  Bob Seifert&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;&#10;Long hampered by cost and beset by international problems, real space exploration did not seem possible for humanity. Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture. &#10;&#10;Expansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped. &#10;&#10;Not knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;Units:  Individual capital ships and fighters&#10;&#10;Time:  Individual fleet battles&#10;&#10;Players:  2 to 6&#10;&#10;Map:  Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Talonverse.....&#10;Talon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story.  This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.&#10;&#10;This is a Fleet Combat game.  Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships.  This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space.  Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman.  Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features.  Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.&#10;&#10;This is an Accessible game.  The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions.  It is also a Fast Paced game.  Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two.  This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.&#10;&#10;How can the game do all this?  All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve.  All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship.  A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it.  The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved.  The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters.   All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker.  All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;     Terran Fleet (10 different ship classes)&#10;     Talon Fleet (9 different ship classes)&#10;     Ships with 4 Shield Arcs&#10;     Fighter Squadrons&#10;     Bases, Transports&#10;     Unique Abilities for each faction&#10;     Asteroids, Planets, Nebulae&#10;     Black Holes, Worm Holes&#10;     6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board&#10;     NFTL and FTL Drives&#10;     12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War&#10;     Mission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...&#10;     Lifetime Score tracking &#10;     Empire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions&#10;     Point System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios&#10;     A tie in with Space Empires 4x&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Carcassonne: The Discovery", "rank": "1960", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.082\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.49\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t2090\t\t", "name": "Carcassonne: The Discovery", "year": "2005", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Leo Colovini", "category": ["Medieval"], "mechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "publisher": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "999 Games", "Albi", "Funagain", "Hobby World", "Piatnik", "Rio Grande Games", "Smart Ltd", "Venice Connection"], "description": "The Discovery is a stand-alone Carcassonne game.&#10;&#10;The inhabitants of Carcassonne have discovered a new region far away from their homeland - one that consists of meadows, mountains and seas. The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.&#10;&#10;This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.&#10;&#10;(From Gamewire and Spielbox)&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "SOS Titanic", "rank": "1961", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.082\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.68\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1320\t\t", "name": "SOS Titanic", "year": "2013", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "30", "designer": "Bruno Cathala", "category": ["Card Game"], "mechanic": ["Cooperative Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "publisher": ["Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "Ludonaute"], "description": "At 23:40 on April 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic, the R.M.S.

Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a few cards from the main deck and tries to move passengers out of the sinking ship onto the lifeboats. Failing to move at least one passenger or needing to reshuffle the main deck might cause one section of the ship to sink, thus reducing the number of piles available as well as the hopes of those still on board. Players can also use action cards to step in at fateful times when things otherwise seem lost.

Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand.  Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of human amazons that ride large mutated beasts, a third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be,  unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully.  The Last Stand may be our last hope.  I don't know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for.&quot;&#10;--Taken from the Journal of Marha Bourne Star&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game", "rank": "1963", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.082\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.63\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t1613\t\t", "name": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game", "year": "2000", "min_players": "2", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "90", "max_time": "90", "designer": "Rob Daviau", "category": ["Horror", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "mechanic": ["Role Playing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "publisher": ["Hasbro", "Milton Bradley"], "description": "Now it's up to you to help Buffy and her friends stop the spread of Evil in Sunnydale!

Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas.&#10;&#10;Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron&rsquo;s train reaches the last track.&#10;&#10;To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?&#10;&#10;The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons &ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized.&#10;&#10;Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid.&#10;&#10;Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement.&#10;&#10;"}, {"name_clean": "SteamRollers", "rank": "1973", "geek_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.080\t\t", "avg_rating": "\n\t\t\t6.85\t\t", "votes": "\n\t\t\t992\t\t", "name": "SteamRollers", "year": "2015", "min_players": "1", "max_players": "5", "min_time": "30", "max_time": "45", "designer": "Mark Gerrits", "category": ["Dice", "Trains"], "mechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Network and Route Building", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Take That"], "publisher": ["Flatlined Games", "2 Pionki", "Portal Games", "Stronghold Games"], "description": "In SteamRollers, players use dice to build the best railway network, upgrade their engine, and beat their opponents to the most lucrative cargo deliveries.

Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn.

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.&#10;&#10;Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.
